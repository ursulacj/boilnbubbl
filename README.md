### Join Sabrina at the Academy of Unseen Arts! 
### Face off against other novice witches and warlocks and test your potion-making skills in the Boil and Bubble Challenge in Professor Lovecraft's Potion's 101 class!

---

The challenge is simple. Two players are given a base component. They take turns carefully selecting one material component to add to the cauldron. 

Add the wrong ingredient with the wrong phraseology and the concoction will putrefy. 

The first to cause rancification loses!

---

As a novice in a friendly setting, the loser won't be forced to drink the rancid spoils. Instead, the loser will be able to use the opportunity to learn and take notes about the stable formulas, strengthening their memories over time. 

With time, careful observation, and practice, you can climb the ranks and go from Novice to Expert. 

You might even be able to unseat Hilda Spellman as Champion Bubbler!
